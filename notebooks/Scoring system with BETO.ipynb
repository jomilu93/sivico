    "**Choice of BETO:** We choose BETO, a BERT model trained on Spanish corpora, because our text data is in Spanish and we need a model that understands the semantic meaning of sentences. BERT models are great at this because they're designed to understand the context of words in a sentence. By using BETO, we capture more complex language features compared to simpler techniques like TF-IDF.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Generating Embeddings:** We use BETO to generate embeddings for both the senators' initiative profiles and the user's input. These embeddings are vectors in a high-dimensional space that represent the semantic meaning of the text. By representing the text as vectors, we can calculate the distance (or similarity) between different pieces of text.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Calculating Similarity:** To match the user's input to the senators' profiles, we calculate the cosine similarity between the user's input vector and each senator's vector. This gives us a measure of how similar the user's input is to each senator's profile, which we use as our scoring mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ranking Senators:** Finally, we rank the senators based on their similarity scores and return the top N senators. This gives us a list of senators whose initiative profiles best match the user's interests.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core idea of this approach is to leverage the power of language models like BETO to understand the semantic meaning of text and use this to match users with senators based on their interests."
